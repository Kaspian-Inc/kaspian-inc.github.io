## Payment Methods
Payment methods can be managed in the Billing tab. Simply add your credit card number and address.

If you have multiple payment methods stored, the one that you want to use as default can be toggled here. Only one method can be default at a time.

## Invoices
Clicking on the Invoice button will bring up the current and historical invoices.

The current invoice will be marked as "Draft" whereas paid ones will be marked "Paid." Kaspian offers metered billing, so the itemized cost breakdown will be a proportion of the total AWS bill for the resources consumed running Kaspian infrastructure.
