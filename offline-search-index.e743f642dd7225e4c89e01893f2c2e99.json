Because they are required at every transformation within a graph, schemas ensure that Kaspian Pipelines are strongly typed and thereby protect the data integrity of downstream data sinks.\n[PICTURE OF EXAMPLE SCHEMA]\nThe Schema editor can be accessed via the Pipelines tab: after navigating to Pipelines, the Components view and the Graph Builder view can be toggled using the top right button.\n[PICTURE OF TAB TOGGLE BUTTON]\nLike Tasks, Schemas can be scoped to specific Pipelines or be configured to have global scope (i.e. used in any Pipeline). Scoping serves both to help organize Schemas and to facilitate their reuse in different Pipelines. Note that while the scope of a Schema cannot be changed after it has been created, Schemas can be cloned into other Pipelines scopes or into the global scope using the Schema editor.\nThe editor also enables Schema to be edited and deleted. Schemas cannot be deleted until all Tasks, Pipelines, and Datastores that use them are also deleted and Kaspian will present the user with the relevant dependency conflict chain if a delete operation is requested.\nTask Schemas All Tasks have either an input Schema or an output Schema; many require both. The input Schema defines the structure of data entering a Task while the output Schema defines the structure of data exiting a Task.\n[PICTURE OF EXAMPLE FIELD]\nA Schema consists of an ordered array of fields. A field has four elements: name, description, datatype, and nullable. name refers to the column name being referenced. Note that this value must be unique within a given Schema. description is meant to provide a space for users to add any useful documentation about the field. datatype values must be selected from the following list of supported options:\n   Datatype Description     ARRAY Array-type values   BINARY Binary values   BOOLEAN True or false values   BYTE Byte values   DATE Dates without time values   DECIMAL Rational values with specified precision   DOUBLE Double precision values   FLOAT Floating point values   INTEGER Integer values   LONG 32-bit signed integer values   MAP Key-value pairs   SHORT 16-bit signed integer values   STRING Text or varchar values   TIMESTAMP Dates with time(zone) values    In general, Kaspian is compatible with any datatype supported by Apache Spark and maps types from Datastores to this list the same way a Spark engine would.\nThe nullable flag is a boolean option that specifies if the value for that specific field is allowed to be null. This option can serve as a valuable data integrity check for required fields.\nDatastore Schemas Tables registered in flat file/data lake environments such as AWS S3 can be added as Datastores [LINK - S3 DATASTORES]. This abstraction allows these resources to behave identically to SQL Datastores such as Snowflake and Postgres within the Kaspian compute layer. Kaspian requires that these Datastores have a Schema attached so that data integrity can be programmatically enforced. It is recommended that Datastore Schemas have global scope so that they can be reused by other Pipelines.\n","categories":"","description":"Flexible data structures\n","excerpt":"Flexible data structures\n","ref":"/pipelinecomponents/schemas/","tags":"","title":"Schemas"},{"body":"Postgres, Aurora, and Redshift Kaspian supports data ingest from most Postgres-compatible data stores, including those that require SSH tunneling via a Bastion host.

They enable data to be read in, transformed, and written back out to connected Datastores and thereby greatly simplify data manipulation in any environment at any scale.\n[PICTURE OF EXAMPLE TASK]\nThe Task editor can be accessed via the Pipelines tab: after navigating to Pipelines, the Components view and the Graph Builder view can be toggled using the top right button.\n[PICTURE OF TAB TOGGLE BUTTON]\nLike Schemas, Tasks can be scoped to specific Pipelines or be configured to have global scope (i.e. used in any Pipeline). Scoping serves both to help organize Tasks and to facilitate their reuse in different Pipelines. Note that while the scope of a Task cannot be changed after it has been created, Tasks can be cloned into other Pipeline scopes or into the global scope using the Task editor.\nThe editor also enables Tasks to be edited and deleted. Tasks cannot be deleted until all Pipeline that use them are also deleted and Kaspian will present the user with the relevant dependency conflict chain if a delete operation is requested.\nAll Tasks require name, type, and description fields and the name field is required to be unique for Tasks of a given type within a given Pipeline.\nData Readers Data Readers are used to read data from registered Datastores. As they are the only task with this capability, Data Readers serve as the root nodes for all Pipeline graphs. In a Pipeline graph, Data Readers may only have outbound edges.\n[PICTURE OF DATA READER]\nAdditionally, Data Readers have the following fields:\nSource Datastore: The datastore to read from.\nCode Source: A link to a .sql file on GitHub. The SQL query must be Spark SQL compliant. The file can be on any branch in any repository so long as the connected GitHub integration [LINK GITHUB INTEGRATION] has read access to it. The SQL file contains the query to be run against the source Datastore in order to load in data.\n[SQL CODE BLOCK]\nFor S3 datastores, note that the special constant data is used to indicate the table object (see above example).\nOutput Schema: The schema of the data produced by the query contained in the code source.\nData Writers Data Writers are used to write data to registered Datastores. As they are the only task with this capability, Data Writers serve as the leaf (terminal) nodes for all Pipeline graphs. In a Pipeline graph, Data Writers may only have inbound edges.\n[PICTURE OF DATA WRITER]\nAdditionally, Data Writers have the following fields:\nDestination Datastore: The Datastore to write to.\nInput Schema: The Schema of the data being written to the specified Datastore. For S3 Datastores this should exactly match the Schema specified for that Datastore on the Datastore page.\nWrite Mode: A directive specifying the write mode behavior of the task. Data Writers can either append to or overwrite the specified table (or for S3 Datastores, the contents of the associated S3 path).\nDestination Table: The Datastore table to write to. This field is only enabled for SQL Datastores. It is advisable to explicitly specify the full table path (schema.table).\nSQL Transforms SQL Transforms allow for the manipulation of data, either from outputs of other transformations or directly from Data Readers, using SQL. This source-agnostic nature of the Kaspian execution engine means that a single SQL query is capable of accessing and operating upon data from multiple Datastores and/or Pipeline branches. In a Pipeline graph, SQL Transforms may have any number of both inbound and outbound edges.\n[PICTURE OF SQL TRANSFORM]\nAdditionally, Data Writers have the following fields:\nOutput Schema: The schema of the data produced by the query contained in the code source.\nInput Schemas: Each inbound edge to a SQL Transform represents a different data source, corresponding either to a Data Reader output or to an intermediate output of another transform Task. In order to distinguish between these inbound edges when writing the transformation query each edge must be configured with an alias and a schema.\n[PICTURE OF ALIASES NEXT TO DAG]\nWhile the same schema can be used multiple times within a SQL Transform if the data sources being read from have the same structure, aliases must be unique. An alias refers to the name that the input source table is referred to in the SQL query contained in the code source (see example below). This abstraction means that any intermediate data stage can be referred to and operated upon as if it were a materialized table even if this isn’t the case.\nCode Source: A link to a .sql file on GitHub. The file can be on any branch in any repository so long as the connected GitHub integration [LINK GITHUB INTEGRATION] has read access to it. The SQL file contains the query to be run using the aliases provided in the Input Schemas as table names. The query must be Spark SQL compliant. Below is an example query that utilizes the aliases above:\n[PICTURE OF QUERY THAT UTILIZES ALIASES PROVIDED]\nPython Function Transforms Python DataFrame Transforms ","categories":"","description":"Read, write, and transform\n","excerpt":"Read, write, and transform\n","ref":"/pipelinecomponents/tasks/","tags":"","title":"Tasks"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page.
